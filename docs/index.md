# polecat
Phylogenetic Overview & Local Epidemiological Cluster Analysis Tool


<strong>polecat</strong> is a tool developed with 'real-time' genomics in mind. 

Using a background phylogeny, such as the large phylogeny available through the COG-UK infrastructure on CLIMB, <strong>polecat</strong> will identify and flag clusters based on various configurable statistics. 


A fully customisable report is generated, summarising information about the clusters of interest.
