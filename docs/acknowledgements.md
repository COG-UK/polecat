### Acknowledgements
```
We acknowledge the hard work from all members of the 
COG-UK consortium that has gone into generating the 
data used by `polecat`.

We acknowledge the hard work and open-science of the 
individual research labs and public health bodies 
that have made their genome data accessible on GISAID. 
A detailed table of acknowledgements for the SARS-CoV-2
genome sequences used to build this lineage system is 
hosted [here](https://github.com/cov-ert/clusterfunk))
